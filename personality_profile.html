      <li>INFP-T </li>

      <li>A Theorist/ pragmatist. Lacking in activist archetype</li>
    </strong> </ul>
    <p>The Myers-briggs and learning styles tests indicate a strong tendency towards pursuing creative and experimental endeavours and hint at the benefits of learning via modelling and practicals where possible and storytelling/ problem setting otherwise. Both suggest an ability to bring unconventional ideas to the table and single-minded drive when a passion project is uncovered. The Myers-Briggs also refers to a certain naivety/ tendency to set unrealistic expectations, all of which I, admittedly, can relate to. The Leadership style assessment test describes a postmodern leader as one who understands “leadership is both an art and a science”, postmodern leaders being people who “help others see their own life in a new light”, excelling at improvisation and approaching different ideas with trust and mutual respect. I’m not certain I’ve put myself in enough situations yet to accurately assess the validity of these claims for myself. </p>
