    <h1>Ideal Job</h1>

    <p>Neuroscience, much like the rest of specialised medicine, suffers from a lack of generalists…as hinted by the term “specialised medicine”. It allowed scientists to explore minutiae within systems and uncover the mechanism of action for a countless number of specific minuscule processes occurring within the body. This focus on specific individual processes also assisted in securing funding as goals and outcomes could be made more concrete and definable. The same can be said for neuroscience, where careers are made studying individual structures or diseases localised to specific areas of the brain.

    I’m drawn to this specific field because integrative neuroscience combines and interprets all this research to create maps of how complex behaviours are developed and how multiple structures interact with each other, providing further insight into processes such as brain plasticity.

    I hope to, at some point, hold a position in which I’m able to both teach and conduct research, ideally in the UK and this position seems to fill those criteria perfectly.
    </p>



    <h2>Skills required</h2>

    <p>The position requires significant teaching experience, an appropriate PhD, a proven history of impactful research. It also requires grant writing experience and the ability to juggle pastoral duties alongside self-directed research and administrative duties simultaneously</p>


    <h2>Skills possessed</h2>

    <p>I currently possess 2.5 years’ worth of a medical science degree and a cert IV in Lab Tech. </p>
