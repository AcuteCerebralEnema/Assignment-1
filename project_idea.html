    <h1>Project outline </h1>
    <hr id="divider02">
<p>I have, for a number of years held the fantasy of creating a projection system, based on a VR headset, built into a handheld antique mirror. In summary this device projects a video through an ordinary looking mirror creating a “scrying” effect, allowing the user to see moving environments within the mirror. The mirror will be capable of determining its location in relation to the user’s head, meaning the user can hold the mirror in various positions allowing the user to view the scene within the mirror from multiple angles, much like a VR experience played in a static position. Any electronics must remain hidden within the structure of the mirror itself.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This project is purely self-serving. My friends and I intend to conduct a theatrical séance experience for festivals next year and a scrying mirror. This project interests me due to how unique the effect is from a theatrical standpoint as well as the wide range of skills required to create it including an understanding of gyroscopes, accelerometers, electronics, programming, object recognition software, light optics and 3d printing/ mould fabrication. It also circumvents the usual shortcomings of routines involving sleight of hand, as the effect is “self-working” and allows full focus to be given to worldbuilding and presentational aspects of the show. </p>


<h2>Detailed explanation</h2>
<p>The ideal scenario would involve developing a stand-alone, self-contained handheld smart mirror capable of detecting its position in relation to its user’s eyes such that moving scenes played through the glass responds and shifts dependent upon where the user holds the mirror, similar to a google cardboard headset. However, having seen the size and complexity of a smart mirror it may be a requirement that positional tracking data be sent from external monitors to the mirror. Possible methods of tracking include facial recognition systems much like Snapchat’s or Instagram’s. It may otherwise be possible to place fluorescent dots on the forehead of the participant, allowing the mirror to track the dot rather than having to integrate facial recognition software similar to a motion capture system. Alternatively, a pseudo constellation tracking system may be implemented with IR markers on the mirror and IR diodes that may be worn by the participant (potentially integrated into some “protective garb/helmet” to shield them from the potential adverse effects of scrying. Output from the diodes would be processed by sensors placed around the stage and sent back to the mirror. This idea is based on Oculus VR tracking methods
In the scenario where adding these capabilities to a handheld mirror is unfeasible, a wall mounted mirror will suffice.
The device would also use a 2-way mirror to integrate smart glass effects in which images can be projected on a reflective surface. It should be noted that a wall mounted mirror would only require 180-degree videos, a handheld mirror would require full 360-degree coverage.


This project requires an understanding of Python, raspberry pi, accelerometers, optics, IR detection and facial recognition/ motion capture, as well as the ability to print 3d models or in the case of the wall mounted mirror, a capable woodworker would be required. The project would also require a raspberry pi, IR sensors, IR markers/ diodes, a small (17cm) computer monitor. While the parts are rather easy to obtain, the technical skills will take diligent effort to develop. However, I’m familiar with the community makerspaces around Melbourne and am confident that I’ll be able to learn the whatever may be required to build a working prototype for assignment 2. </p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Admittedly this pet peeve may seem childish and unsubstantial to most in that it doesn’t solve any pressing universal humanitarian issue, however, it is the case that the magic community is very much a victim of a lack of originality. Classic routines from over a century ago have become crutches for those unwilling to experiment. of course, these routines, in the right hands, still produce results, leave audiences amazed and generate repeat bookings. Why change that which is not broken? But I feel this mindset is restrictive and borders on a lack of integrity, something that my friends and I make a concerted effort to avoid when writing for shows. The intention behind a project like this is to ensure our shows stand out and provide audiences with an experience that is worth their time and money. </p>
