    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Aby is a student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in IT at RMIT, Melbourne. Being born in Australia to Indian parents, he fluent in both English and Malayalam-an Indian dialect spoken in the south-western state of Kerala. He graduated from John Monash Science School and began to pursue a degree in Medical Science before transferring to his current degree. He is also an accomplished magician and has consulted for multiple award-winning Fringe shows (<a href="https://tayaroundtown.com/2020/03/05/adl-fringe-2020-review-suspension-of-disbelief/" target="_blank">2020</a>, 2021, <a href="https://adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/ta-da-the-ramblings-of-a-magician-af2022" target="_blank">2022</a>) and several corporate audiences including Coca-Cola. He writes in third person because the drafts in first person made him feel pretentious...and yet writing in third person doesn't seem to alleviate that sensation either. He currently resides in Point Cook with his cavoodle, Annie, as well as his parents and 3 siblings </p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>I joined a Bachelors of IT primarily for a change of environment. I’d been blindly trudging through a medical science degree for several years in Adelaide and, after a series of unfortunate events, found myself rather disillusioned with academia in general. I decided to withdraw for the semester and kept myself busy by learning some very basic Python.
My interest in it was multifaceted. My med sci supervisors had told me knowledge of Python and R were highly sought after in research labs and as I intend to eventually return to biological research, I concluded that pursuing an IT degree would be a justifiable use of time before I went back. Artificial neural networks and Machine learning are also incredibly fascinating fields of study that I hope this degree will allow me to explore more thoroughly.
Beyond that, I also hope to use these skills in prop building and illusion design. I frequently find myself in positions where a basic understanding of python would reduce outsourcing costs, help fix errors on the fly, and open myself up to an infinite number of new potential effects.
Clean website design is also a heavily overlooked selling point when booking clients, especially when
A primary reason for my hiatus from research stemmed from the lack of practical, self-guided, real world applicable study I was able to undertake during an undergraduate degree. I’ve found that this IT degree offers significantly more creative freedom and opportunities for open collaboration which I enjoy immensely.
I was drawn specifically to RMIT as both my mother and grandmother earned degrees here.

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>Neuroscience, much like the rest of specialised medicine, suffers from a lack of generalists…as hinted by the term “specialised medicine”. It allowed scientists to explore minutiae within systems and uncover the mechanism of action for a countless number of specific minuscule processes occurring within the body. This focus on specific individual processes also assisted in securing funding as goals and outcomes could be made more concrete and definable. The same can be said for neuroscience, where careers are made studying individual structures or diseases localised to specific areas of the brain.

I’m drawn to this specific field because integrative neuroscience combines and interprets all this research to create maps of how complex behaviours are developed and how multiple structures interact with each other, providing further insight into processes such as brain plasticity.

I hope to, at some point, hold a position in which I’m able to both teach and conduct research, ideally in the UK and this position seems to fill those criteria perfectly.
</p>

<h3>Skills required</h3>
<p>The position requires significant teaching experience, an appropriate PhD, a proven history of impactful research. It also requires grant writing experience and the ability to juggle pastoral duties alongside self-directed research and administrative duties simultaneously</p>
<h3>Skills possessed</h3>
<p>I currently possess 2.5 years’ worth of a medical science degree and a cert IV in Lab Tech. </p>
<h3>How to achieve goal</h3>
<p>
  1)	Maintain HD average… <br>
2)	Email labs with undergraduate research opportunities <br>
3)	Contribute to research and get published <br>
4)	Apply for csiro UROP program <br>
5)	Complete Bachelor of IT course <br>
6)	Transfer credits for medical science and complete final topics <br>
7)	Pray you’ve done enough to be accepted into PhD candidacy <br>
8)	Otherwise enrol in Neuroscience Master’s program <br>
9)	Apply for teaching roles at universities <br>
10)	(Now apply for PhD) <br>
11)	Cure Parkinson’s disease and probably world hunger as well. Why not <br>
12)	Receive Nobel Prize <br>
13)	Have Oxford offer tenured teaching position with free reign over labs <br>
14)	Ignore previously advertised position. You’ve surpassed it anyway <br>
</p>
<h2>Personality profile</h2>
<p><strong>- INFP-T <br>
- A postmodern leader <br>
- A Theorist/ pragmatist. Lacking in activist archetype
</strong> <br>
The Myers-briggs and learning styles tests indicate a strong tendency towards pursuing creative and experimental endeavours and hint at the benefits of learning via modelling and practicals where possible and storytelling/ problem setting otherwise. Both suggest an ability to bring unconventional ideas to the table and single-minded drive when a passion project is uncovered. The Myers-Briggs also refers to a certain naivety/ tendency to set unrealistic expectations, all of which I, admittedly, can relate to. The Leadership style assessment test describes a postmodern leader as one who understands “leadership is both an art and a science”, postmodern leaders being people who “help others see their own life in a new light”, excelling at improvisation and approaching different ideas with trust and mutual respect. I’m not certain I’ve put myself in enough situations yet to accurately assess the validity of these claims when referencing myself. </p>
