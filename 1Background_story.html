    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

    <p>I joined a Bachelors of IT primarily for a change of environment. I’d been blindly trudging through a medical science degree for several years in Adelaide and, after a series of unfortunate events, found myself rather disillusioned with academia in general. I decided to withdraw for the semester and kept myself busy by learning some very basic Python.
    My interest in it was multifaceted. My med sci supervisors had told me knowledge of Python and R were highly sought after in research labs and as I intend to eventually return to biological research, I concluded that pursuing an IT degree would be a justifiable use of time before I went back. Artificial neural networks and Machine learning are also incredibly fascinating fields of study that I hope this degree will allow me to explore more thoroughly.
    Beyond that, I also hope to use these skills in prop building and illusion design. I frequently find myself in positions where a basic understanding of python would reduce outsourcing costs, help fix errors on the fly, and open myself up to an infinite number of new potential effects.
    Clean website design is also a heavily overlooked selling point when booking clients, especially when
    A primary reason for my hiatus from research stemmed from the lack of practical, self-guided, real world applicable study I was able to undertake during an undergraduate degree. I’ve found that this IT degree offers significantly more creative freedom and opportunities for open collaboration which I enjoy immensely.
    I was drawn specifically to RMIT as both my mother and grandmother earned degrees here.
